[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bcb8fb84-db4c-453c-b5f7-43b4f6c2b93b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/makerscovid-expo/deploys)

This is website uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL)


## Getting started

First, clone and install npm packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/essenlive/makersxcovid-expo
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deployment

The website will be automatically [here](https://makerscovid-expo.netlify.app/) deployed on each pushed commit.
